# Egghead.io Redux Course Notes
This repo contains my notes from [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon)'s _excellent_ [Redux video series](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-the-single-immutable-state-tree).

These notes contain a lot of verbatim transcriptions, along with additional rewrites, links, etc. that I added along the way. Feel free to submit additions to these notes, but please don't remove anything (unless I messed up or misunderstood something).

Some of these documents contain multiple sections, but the majority are "one doc per vid" (there are 30 videos covered in 25 pages). Each section contains a link to the video, and towards the end of this undertaking I started adding a timestamped link to Dan's "what we just did" recaps at the end of each lesson. 

These notes _do not_ contain a full product of the code written over the course of the course.

### Feel free to submit a PR!
